## MyFunds

### Description

MyFunds is a personal finance app that allows the user to keep track of their funds by entering transaction information which will then be neatly displayed.

As long as the window remains open, the entered information will be saved within the browser using LocalStorage. This gives the user the option to edit or remove listed items.

**Once the window is closed or refreshed, the app will reset and all entered information is erased.**

Financial categories that are tracked within this app include:

+ Budget
+ Income
+ Expenses
+ Goals
 
Within each category are multiple sub-categories that the user can choose from to further specify what type of transaction they wish to keep track of.

Once a card or list item is displayed, the user can then edit or remove items to their satisfaction.

### Motivation

I wanted a simple app where I can enter and see all of my financial activity, instead of jumping between multiple banking apps. Inspiration also came from individuals who have multiple incomes such as side hustles, passive income, part-time jobs, etc. It can all be easily monitored using this app.
